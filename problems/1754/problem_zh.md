## 题目描述

Bulls are so much better at math than the cows. They can multiply huge integers together and get perfectly precise answers ... or so they say. Farmer John wonders if their answers are correct. Help him check the bulls' answers.

Read in two **positive** integers **(no more than $40$ digits each)** and compute their product. Output it as a normal number **(with no extra leading zeros)**. FJ asks that you do this yourself; **don't use a special library function for the multiplication**.
